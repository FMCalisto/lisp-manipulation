### Introduction to Common Lisp List Manipulation

This is a short introduction to Common Lisp List Manipulation.


## Preface

description of the Common-Lisp language.

Common-Lisp functions in a read-eval-print loop: reading 
expressions, evaluation of expressions, writing results. 

While reading an expression, the interpreter find a point 
semicolon (;), ignores the text to the end of the line. Meet # | ignores 
the text to | #.


## Exercises

Expression evaluation is performed according to a set of rules, 
which are presented below in simplified form:

1. A list is represented as a sequence of pairs. Define a function 
which returns the last couple of sequence pairs that constitute a list (with cond).

2. Function that reverses a list using recursive process.

3. Returns the list of sublists of the list received as argument.
